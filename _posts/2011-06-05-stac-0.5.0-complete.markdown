title: STAC 0.5.0 Complete
---

The Base to STAC is complete. (0.5.0)

It provides absolute basic TK management options, nothing more than a "Forgive" and "Punish" option, but no special punishments or per-mod support has been implemented yet.

Here is a list of what has been implemented.

	* Basic Forgive/Punish
	* Basic Kill-Based Karma
	* Auto-Update Support
	* Logging (for stat-interpretation)
	* Tiered Punishment (X Represents a cvar so if you don't want any kicking to happen, just set to 0, etc.)
		** X Team Attacks = 1 Team Kill
		** X Team Kills = 1 Kick
		** X Kicks = 1 Temp Ban
		** X Bans = Perma-Ban
	* Plugin Natives/Forwards
