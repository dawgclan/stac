title: STAC 0.5.0 Complete
---

The Base to STAC is complete. (0.5.0)

It provides absolute basic TK management options, nothing more than a "Forgive" and "Punish" option, but no special punishments or per-mod support has been implemented yet.

Here is a list of what has been implemented.
<ul>
	<li>Basic Forgive/Punish</li>
	<li>Basic Kill-Based Karma</li>
	<li>Auto-Update Support</li>
	<li>Logging (for stat-interpretation)</li>
	<li>Tiered Punishment (X Represents a cvar so if you don't want any kicking to happen, just set to 0, etc.)</li>
	<ul>
		<li>X Team Attacks = 1 Team Kill</li>
		<li>X Team Kills = 1 Kick</li>
		<li>X Kicks = 1 Temp Ban</li>
		<li>X Bans = Perma-Ban</li>
	</ul>	
	<li>Plugin Natives/Forwards</li>
</ul>
