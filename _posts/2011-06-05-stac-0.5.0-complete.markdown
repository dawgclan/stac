The Base to STAC is complete. (0.5.0)

It provides absolute basic TK management options, nothing more than a "Forgive" and "Punish" option, but no special punishments or per-mod support has been implemented yet.

Here is a list of what has been implemented.

	* Basic Forgive/Punish</li>
	* Basic Kill-Based Karma</li>
	* Auto-Update Support</li>
	* Logging (for stat-interpretation)</li>
	* Tiered Punishment (X Represents a cvar so if you don't want any kicking to happen, just set to 0, etc.)
		** X Team Attacks = 1 Team Kill</li>
		** X Team Kills = 1 Kick</li>
		** X Kicks = 1 Temp Ban</li>
		** X Bans = Perma-Ban</li>
	* Plugin Natives/Forwards
