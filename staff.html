    <h1>What is STAC?</h1>
    <p>STAC stands for Source Team Attack Control, the name is based on it's predecessor, Advaned Team Attack Control: Source, which was based on IT'S predecessor, Advanced Team Attack Control.</p>
<h2>Why change the name?</h2>
    <p>Despite the fact that I, FlyingMongoose am the author of ATAC: Source, and I've had blessings from the old ATAC community to make use of the name, this particular iteration is somewhat of a rewrite of ATAC, utilizing different data storage methods and a much cleaner writing of the code in general. It is also a collaborative effort, with input from Rothgar the writer of the Simple TK Manager, and Tsunami, the lead coder for SourceBans and whom has done a rewrite of ATAC: Source himself. So some fresh faces, some old faces, and a fresh new name. Source Team Attack Control, because you can't be everywhere.</p>
